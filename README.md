# pikkit

Pikkit is a machine learning tool for predicting the popularity of Instagram posts.

This repository consists of a python package, an ipython script, and a web app. The script scrapes Instagram data and trains a linear regression model based on the data. It automatically rejects outliers and selects features based on their importance.

The web app allows users to upload images and get recommendations from the regression model running on the backend. It is hosted at www.pikkit.site
